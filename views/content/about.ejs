    I am R.J. Freund, a <%= getAge('1990-08-17'); %> year old male senior Computer Science student at University of Wisconsin - Oshkosh.
    I currently make websites in Oshkosh, WI, but I also specialize in computer repair and software engineering.
    I enjoy reading, practicing Tai Chi, and messing around with computers. My wife and I both sing in the newVoices choir, previously known as the White Heron Chorale. I currently live with my wife, Risa, in Oshkosh, WI.
